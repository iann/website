title: I'll call your 1mm and raise you a Retina Display

[Alleged iPad 3 casing photo appears, sources say coming soon with improved GPU but no quad-core, thicker profile](http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/8/2785486/ipad-3-back-photo-appears-a6-retina-display "The Verge")

The iPad 3 rumor mill is heating up. From the Verge's Joshua Topolsky:

>The new iPad will be touting that double resolution display — a true iPad Retina Display, clocking in at 2048 x 1536 — the device will be nearly physically identical to its predecessor, but the slate will be about one millimeter thicker overall.

I know I'm not the only one that will gladly take a little thicker device for a 2048 x 1536 pixel display. Think about how nice typography will look.

An upgraded GPU and CPU (A6) are expected, too. The CPU however may not be quad core -- a bit of a surprise. It probably has something to do with the constant battle of battery life vs new tech. I'm sure Apple will spin it with, "a dual-core chip is really all anyone needs right now." And you know what? Apple is probably right. 

Too often do manufactures promise the sun and then deliver poor performance. Note: this would not be the first time an Apple product was late to the party stepping up the cores. It was not until the iPhone 4 that Apple embraced a dual-core mobile chip. This is also true of their notebook line. Apple's MacBook Air was only recently updated to quad-core only in the latest hardware refresh. At each of these times Apple was signifigantly behind the industry standard. But it doesn't matter. Both the MacBook Air and iPhone provided vastly superior user experiences and customers saw it.
