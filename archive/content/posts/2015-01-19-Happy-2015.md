Happy New Year! I'm excited to relaunch my personal website. Here's the "stack"
I decided to go with:

* [Node](http://nodejs.org/) + [Bower](http://bower.io/) + [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* GitHub ([repository](https://github.com/iann/iann.github.com/tree/develop) + [hosting](https://pages.github.com/))
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) (CDN + SSL)
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/iann/iann.github.com) (Automated deployment)

<!--more-->

It's a pretty straightforward stack as the site is static HTML + CSS. I want to
thank [Sean Farrell](http://www.rioki.org/) for putting together an awesome
[gulpfile](https://github.com/rioki/www.rioki.org/blob/master/gulpfile.js) as a
base. His whole repo is located [here](https://github.com/rioki/www.rioki.org).

Also, thanks [BlackTie](http://www.blacktie.co/) for creating
[this](http://www.blacktie.co/2014/01/stanley-freelancer-theme/) awesome
bootstrap template that I could modify to fit my needs.
