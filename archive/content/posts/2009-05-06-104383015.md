title: Do more with Google Gears
---

<p>Google Gears allows users to work on things found online, offline.  Neat.  Basically, this allows someone to read cache all their Gmail messages and read them when no longer connected to the cloud.  Gears goes a little further, one can also compose email, to be queued and sent when a connection is found.  This feature is not perfect though.  Composing the text of the email goes off without a hitch, there is seemly no difference between composing an email on or offline.  You cannot upload an attachment though.  When attempting to, I was greeted with this (so Google) error message.</p>

<p>The error message does hint at it being a feature that Google possibly wants to add, noting how far Gmail has come.  I think it&#8217;s an interesting feature, and suggest giving it a try.  Just click on Settings then the Labs tab.</p>
