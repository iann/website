Here's a good article that overviews on the current state of modern Javascript
tooling.

Part of what makes Javascript extremely powerful and what attracted me to it is
its flexibility and lack of opinions. This can make it difficult for a beginner
to get started since so little is given to newcomers. Projects like
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) help a lot in getting things off the ground for new
developers or seasoned ones trying out a new framework or tool. Personally, one
of the first things I do when checking out a new Javascript framework is look
for Yeoman project featuring it to get up and running quickly.
