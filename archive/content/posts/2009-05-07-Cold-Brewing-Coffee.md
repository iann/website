<p>There are few things that beat sitting out on the patio of my favorite coffee shop (<a href="http://www.raoscoffee.com/">Rao&#8217;s Coffee</a>) on a warm spring day, drinking an ice coffee.  There are a few issues with this, I&#8217;m a student (poor) and going to Rao&#8217;s everyday adds up.<br/>Turns out you can get that very same coffee shop taste with the help of some inexpensive supplies and a little bit of time, by cold brewing your coffee.<br/><br/>Step One - Supplies <img src="http://19.media.tumblr.com/4tg1YGmz6n7he24plgOD4QXYo1_500.jpg" align="right" height="250" width="187"/></p>

<p>First you&#8217;re going to need a container to steep the coffee in.  I reused a glass bottle that originally contained Voss Sparkling water.  The shape of the bottle doesn&#8217;t really matter, what matters is that it&#8217;s glass.</p>

<p>Second is the coffee beans.  Pick up your favorite kind, just make sure it is a coarse ground.  I&#8217;ve used both Rao&#8217;s <a href="http://www.raoscoffee.com/order.htm">Sumatra</a> and Blue Bottle Coffee&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bluebottlecoffee.net/Detail.bok?no=1">Bella Donovan</a>, both having great full flavorful tastes.</p>

<p>Coffee filters are also needed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 cup of coarse-ground coffee and stir it into 4&#160;1/2 cups of water</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In my case that comes out to 12 tablespoons of coffee, working within a 1L bottle.<br/><br/>Add water, then put the cap on and shake up the mixture, until all the coffee has saturated with water.<br/><br/>Next stick the mixture into the fridge and let it sit for 12-24 hours, depending on how strong you like you&#8217;re coffee.<br/><br/>Use one of those coffee filters you bought and run the coffee once through.  Smells good!<br/><br/>Step Three - Tasting</p>

<p>This is a highly caffeinated substance, due to the long steep time.  To cut the strength of the coffee add either water, cream, or milk (you can drink it straight, but be prepared).<br/><br/>Bon Appétit!</p>
